# Heart Disease Classifier

## Overview
This project focuses on building a heart disease classifier using machine learning techniques to assist in early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging a dataset containing various health parameters, the goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can classify individuals as having heart disease or not.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and ensuring data quality.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure and relationships between features using visualizations.
- Model Selection: Explored multiple machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression, selecting the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.
- Feature Scaling & Dimensionality Reduction: Applied feature scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to enhance model efficiency and performance.
- Evaluation Metrics: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics to ensure robustness and reliability.
